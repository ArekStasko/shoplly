## About Shoplly app
I made this project to find out how can i implem ent data filtering, i was trying to do it as
good as possible. After i realized this project i see many problems, mainly with performance, i made
too many if statements, and the way i was filtering and fetching big data is inefficient. Now i see it
and i will develop my skills to avoid this in my future projects.
Whatever i am proud of it and i had so much fun during making this project !
